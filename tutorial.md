Team: Zheng Zhang,3036381242; Yi Zhao,3036410445
## Introduction
This project developed an indoor smart home system to collect data such as temperature, humidity, brightness, etc. And control desk lamps and fans and other devices to provide users with a better home experience. The key technologies involved include STM32 microcontrollers, various sensors for environmental monitoring, and relay modules for device control. In addition, on the web side, streamlit is used to visualize and analyze the collected data, while integrating artificial intelligence to enhance the user experience and promote health.
